# Traffic Accident Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. By leveraging data visualization techniques, we aim to visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors, providing insights for accident prevention and road safety improvement.

## Data Sources
The analysis utilizes traffic accident data sourced from [insert source here], which contains information such as accident location, road conditions, weather conditions, time of day, and severity of the accidents.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive analysis)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn (for advanced visualization)

## Usage
1. Prepare your traffic accident data:
   - Ensure your data is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV) and contains relevant information such as accident location, road conditions, weather conditions, and time of day.
2. Update the file path and column names in the provided Jupyter Notebook (task_05.ipynb)
3. Execute the notebook/script to perform the analysis and visualization:(task_05.ipynb)
4. Explore the generated visualizations to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, time of day, accident hotspots, and contributing factors.
